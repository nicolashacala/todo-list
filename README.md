# To-do List

This project has been done in a pair coding way with [Hippolyte Malgaud](https://github.com/Domoso)

[The instructions](https://github.com/becodeorg/Swartz-promo-3/tree/master/Projects/Todolist)

[Hosted on Heroku](https://becode-todolist.herokuapp.com/)

A simple To-do list, first using PHP and then as an extra, the form had to be updated via an AJAX call.

With this project, we improved our skills in PHP and learned more about AJAX and JSON.
